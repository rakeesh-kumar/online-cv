      - title: Image Recognition
        tagline: "Built a convolutional neural network using a small dataset of time-series dopamine spikes among population ensembles of neurons by employing a pre-trained CNN through Tensorflow. Transformed dataset into heatmaps and wavelets, and wrote an algorithm with Python and OpenCV using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Enhanced this pipeline with Keras, using latest deep learning architecture (VGG16) that is extremely accurate and lean ; essential for our small dataset."
